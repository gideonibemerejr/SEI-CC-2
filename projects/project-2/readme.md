# Project 2<br>Node/Express/MongoDB<br>Full-stack CRUD Application

### Overview

This second project is your first foray into **building a full-stack 
application.** You'll be **building a Node/Express/MongoDB app** from the ground up yourself.

This is exciting and by the end of the week we will have given you the all of the tools needed to build your app.  Here's the best part - you get to decide what you want to build - as long as it meets the technical requirements outlined below.

**You will be working individually for this project.** You'll be 
designing and coding the app yourself. However, you will have access to up to ten, fifteen minute one-on-one sessions with your instructors.

**After next Friday's presentations,** you'll be taking a Project Assessment.

---

### Key Due Dates

- **This Thursday morning**: Share your project's:
	- Wireframes
	- User Stories
	- Entity-Relationship-Diagram (ERD)

- **Next Friday**:  Demo your app!

---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

- **Have at least 2 data entities in addition to the "user" Model**.  One model that represents the main functional idea for your app and another with a **1:M** or **M:M** relationship with that main model (embedded or referenced).
- **Use OAuth authentication**. (lesson this week)
- **Implement basic authorization** by restricting access to certain features, such as editing and deleting a resource, to an authenticated user, or the user that created that resource.
- Have **complete CRUD data operations**.
- Be styled with well-organized and DRY CSS.
- Be **deployed online** (Heroku).

Optionally, your app may:

- Consume a third-party API.
- Expose its own data resources as JSON via an API.

---

### Necessary Deliverables

- A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted on Heroku.
- A **git repository hosted on Github** for your app with **frequent** 
  commits dating back to the **very beginning** of your project. **Commit early, commit often**!
- A **`README.md` file** that includes:
	 - A intro/description of the app.
	 - Screenshot(s)
    - List of the technologies used.
    - Getting Started section with:
    	- Link to your deployed app
    	- Link to your Trello board
    - Unsolved problems (if any)
    - Future (Ice Box) Features
- A **[Trello](https://trello.com/) board** with:
    - **User Stories**, each moving from left to right in the following 
      three lists in your board:
      	- Ice Box
      	- Current/MVP
      	- Completed.
      Prioritize your user stories within the Ice Box with your "wish 
      list" stories at the bottom.
    - **Wireframes of your UI**.
    - An **ERD** showing the attributes of each model (or schema in the case of embedding) and the associations between them. Here's a [YouTube video to show you how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpdhBUYk7Kk).
- **User Stories** must follow the following template:<br>**_As a \<user role\>, I want \<feature\>, because \<reason\>._**<br>The _reason_ is optional if it's blatantly obvious.

---

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Because your app's functionality revolves around the logged in user, **implement authentication and basic navigation first!**
- **If in doubt, discuss your app idea with an instructor to get their feedback before you dive too deep into user stories and wireframes!**
- **Don't underestimate the value of planning what your app should do and more or less look like.**
- **Remember to keep things small and focus on the MVP** – feature creep can doom a project!
- **Seed data** to assist in the development process. (lesson this week)

### Project Idea Guidance

Nearly all of the web applications you interact with on a daily basis
would do for this project as most are "full-stack" CRUD apps.

#### Do Not Do

Non-CRUD applications such as:

- Games
- Portfolio, or presentational pages
- Marketing or content oriented websites

#### Good Examples

Some of the best apps are apps that track or manage things of **personal interest to you**:
  
- Music lesson tracking
- Soccer team tracker
- Rock climbing planner

So much of the Internet is CRUD apps!

- Social media:
  - Twitter
  - Instagram
  - Reddit
- Marketplaces: 
  - Craigslist
  - Etsy
- Organizational or Business apps:
  - Customer management
  - Payroll/Accounting

Many simple apps can have their functionality enhanced by implementing the ability of users to comment on, and/or like/favorite items. 

Another piece of advice:  If you choose to develop an app that has the concept of a shopping cart (storefront), do not attempt to implement the actual payment functionality.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

- Your instructors will be evaluating your project during your demonstration as well as reviewing the code in your repo.
- If there are deficiencies in meeting the requirements, you will be given guidance on what needs to be done to meet the requirements.  Your updated project will be due the Monday following demo Friday.
- If there is a specific section of code that you would like feedback by an instructor on, please ask.
- Use of the code review form as guidance during development of your app is recommended.

### Project 2 Assessment

The goal of the project assessment is to gauge your ability to develop a **minimal** full-stack web application using the Express framework, including your ability to:

- Define a model.
- Define routes.
- Write controller actions to create data and display data.
- Write some basic EJS.

You will work on the assessment individually, however, the assessment is "open book", so you will have access to all notes, code, lessons, google, etc.

The project assessment will begin shortly after project presentations.  It is anticipated that it will take 45 - 90 minutes to complete.  However, if necessary, you'll have up to 3 hours to complete the assessment.
